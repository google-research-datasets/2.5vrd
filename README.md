# 2.5D Visual Relationship Detection (2.5VRD)

2.5VRD studies the depth and occlusion relationships between two arbitrary objects. In particular, there are two scenarios: within-image (depth and occlusion) and cross-image (depth only). For more details on the dataset, please read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12727).

## Data Description

The 2.5VRD dataset contains 110,894 images and 511,454 objects (bounding boxes and class names) from the [Open Images V4](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download_v4.html), where 219,570 pairs of objects are annotated with the depth and occlusion relationships. The table below provides a breakdown of the number of instances in training, validation, and test sets for within-image and cross-image scenarios. We collect exhaustive annotations for the validation and test sets and sparse annotations for the training set.

|               |                | Training | Validation | Test   |
|---------------|----------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Within image  | # images       | 105,694  | 1,200      | 4,000  |
|               | # object pairs | 105,694  | 6,339      | 23,724 |
| Across images | # image pairs  | 52,484   | 600        | 2,000  |
|               | # object pairs | 52,484   | 6,868      | 24,461 |


 
## Data Format

### \*image_object\*.csv

| image_id         | object_id | entity    | xmin         | xmax         | ymin         | ymax         |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 0002ab0af02e4a77 |         0 | /m/09j2d  | 0.4077819884 | 0.8457270265 | 0.3854120076 | 0.9997109771 |
| 0002ab0af02e4a77 |         1 | /m/04hgtk | 0.5341079831 | 0.7458209991 | 0.1274199933 | 0.4624019861 |

* image_id: the unique id for each image from OID V4
* object_id: the object id in the corresponding image
* entity: the entity names defined in OID V4. You can convert it to a class name using OID V4’s class-descriptions-boxable.csv.
* xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax: coordinates of a bounding box, normalized to [0.0, 1.0]


### \*images_vrd\*.csv

| image_id_1       | object_id_1 | image_id_2       | object_id_2 | distance | occlusion | raw_distance | raw_occlusion |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| 0002ab0af02e4a77 |           0 | 0002ab0af02e4a77 |           1 |        0 |         0 | 0,0,0,0,0    | 0,0,0,0,0     |
| 0003d84e0165d630 |           0 | 0003d84e0165d630 |           1 |        2 |         0 | 2,2,2,2,2    | 0,0,0,0,0     |

* image_id_*: the unique id for each image from OID V4
* object_id_*: the object id in the corresponding image
* distance: the depth relationship, taking one of the following values
    * -1: no majority 
    * 0: not sure
    * 1: object_id_1 is closer to the camera than object_id_2 
    * 2: object_id_2 is closer to the camera than object_id_1 
    * 3: object_id_1 is about the same distance to the camera as object_id_2 
* occlusion: the occlusion relationship. We set it to 0 for across_image_vrd_*.csv since the occlusion relationship does not apply to the cross-image scenario. For within-image scenarios, it takes one of the following values
    * -1: no majority
    * 0: no occlusion
    * 1: object_id_1 occludes object_id_2
    * 2: object_id_2 occludes object_id_1 
    * 3: object_id_1 occludes and is occluded by object_id_2
* raw_distance: the raw distance relationships labeled by five or more raters
* raw_occlusion: the occlusion relationships labeled by five or more raters

 
## Evaluation
We provide exhaustive annotations for the validation and test sets (i.e., for every pair of objects), allowing us to evaluate a model’s predictions using precision, recall, and the F-score. Please see the evaluation script (coming soon) for a description of the prediction format that your model should output.
